In this branch we performed a statistical analysis from the comparison of two different controllers for the robot of the [RT1 Assignment 1](https://github.com/mmatteo-hub/RT1_Assignment1).

In our code we used a few functions to collect some data and analise them. We wanted to collect them by the use of a program written for that scope.
The statistical data we collected are:
* Lap time: the time of the lap completed by the robot calculated between two point identified as the start and the end for the statistics;
* Distance travelled by the robot: total distance travelled in terms of unit of the map;
* Number of corrections: total number of correction done by the robot in a single lap due to a wrong trajectory previously computed or due to some obstacles met along the path followed;
