### Professor [Carmine Recchiuto](https://github.com/CarmineD8), Student: [Matteo Maragliano](https://github.com/mmatteo-hub)

#### Repository organization
The repository is divided into 4 different branches:
* **main**
* [**Doxygen**](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html)
* [**Jupyter**](https://jupyter.org)
* [**Sphinx**](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)

Each one represents a different part for the documentation obtained in a different way.
In particular:
* **main** : it is the main branch with the original project code for the [RT1 Assignment3](https://github.com/mmatteo-hub/RT1_Assignment3);
* **doxygen** : it is the branch with the *doxygen* documentation. All node functions are provided particular comment structure to allow the program working properly;
* **jupyter** : it is the branch in which the UI is replaced by the *Jupyter* use;
* **sphinx** : it is the branch with the *sphinx* documentation. It is provided the same code as *doxygen*-branch in order to make the *sphinx* program working properly.

#### Switching the branch
In order to switch the branch and to see the documentation for each one we have to use a temrminal window or a GUI providing the same functionaloties.
We have to be in out directory so : `cd [path]/RT2_Assignment1`; then we have to check the branch we are in by: `git branch`.
To switch from a branch to another we will type: `git chekout [branch name]` where the `[branch name]` parameter has to be chosen by the 4 different branches the reposotory has.
